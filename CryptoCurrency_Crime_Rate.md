# CryptoCurrency Crime Rate

Introduction on the Darknet
Dark Net Markets (DNM) are online markets typically hosted as Tor hidden services providing escrow services between buyers & sellers transacting in Bitcoin or other cryptocoins, usually for drugs or other illegal and regulated goods. The most famous DNM was Silk Road 1, which pioneered the business model in 2011. From 2013-2015 and these datasets covered vendor pages, feedback, images, etc.

# Motivation
It's important to track the international financial crime rate over the internet to help propogate the drugs over the internet.

# Data Source
First plan is to use Kaggle in order to test a sample:

Data includes 100,000 Sets 

Second plan is to implement it over the larger data sets over more datasets:

This uniquely comprehensive collection is now publicly released as a 50GB (~1.6TB uncompressed) collection covering 89 DNMs & 37+ related forums, representing <4,438 mirrors, and is available for any research.

First using the Linear Regression to get a correlation between cyrptocurrency to drug trafficking and then tracking to see the correlation between the increase in bitcoin value and crime rate.
